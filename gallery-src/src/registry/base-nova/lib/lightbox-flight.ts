// A flight: a spring sampled into a frame table, played on the compositor as a Web
// Animation and read back through that animation's own clock. The binder owns the
// DOM (it creates the animations and cancels them); this module owns the table, the
// clock read and the landing rule. Framework-free: the clock is anything with a
// `currentTime`. `bun scripts/examples/lightbox-flight.ts` exercises it.
