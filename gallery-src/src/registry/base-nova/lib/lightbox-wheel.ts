// The wheel session, framework-free. Three axes, all of them the POSE: a ctrl-wheel
// zoom, a pan while zoomed, and the vertical drag that dismisses. Each offsets the
// pose the hand found (`grab`) and lets silence decide where it lands, which is safe
// because each springs back to a resting place, so a mistimed release costs nothing.
//
// There is no horizontal axis. Sideways wheel belongs to the track, and the track is
// a real scroll container: the browser knows when the fingers left the trackpad and
// we do not, so it owns the momentum and the snap. The binder simply does not
// preventDefault a sideways wheel at fit.
//
// `last` is the accepted tick the velocity span is measured against; `at` the last
// cursor; `live` whether a vertical session ever passed the inertia guard. Ticks in,
// a session and effects out; the binder owns the timers and applies the effects.
// `bun scripts/examples/lightbox-wheel.ts`.
